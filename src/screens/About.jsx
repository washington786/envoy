The four women have partnered to co-found Re4m Envoy (Pty) Ltd â€“ a global development and  impact consultancy firm working across sectors of the Sustainable Development Goals. The firm  is 100% female owned originating from the Global South. The idea behind Reform came through reflections and assessments around youth, gender, racial and African inclusion were at an all time importance in the international discourse. Coincidently, all four women were entertaining the idea of doing consultancy work and when they came across each other, it felt like it was now or never. Re4m Envoy was officially started in October 2022, the four women brought their minds together to establish what they hope is going to be one of the biggest female owned development consultancy firms. Offering strategy, project management and  impact assessment services.",
